=head1 SYNOPSIS

    no multidimensional;

    $hash{1, 2};                # dies
    $hash{join($;, 1, 2)};      # doesn't die

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Perl's multidimensional array emulation stems from the days before the
language had references, but these days it mostly serves to bite you
when you typo a hash slice by using the C<$> sigil instead of C<@>.

This module lexically makes using multidimensional array emulation a
fatal error at compile time.

=method unimport

Disables multidimensional array emulation for the remainder of the
scope being compiled.

=cut

sub unimport { $^H |= 0x20000; $^H{+(__PACKAGE__)} = 1 }

=method import

Enables multidimensional array emulation for the remainder of the
scope being compiled;

=cut

sub import { delete $^H{+(__PACKAGE__)} }
